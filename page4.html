	 <h2 align="left"><u>Watching series and movies</u></h2>
	 <p>Series are so damn addictives compared to movies because for a movies you watch one part and its done while for series the 1st season or episode will keep you wondering what happens next in the following season or episode.Series are so addictive and interesting thats if you have good taste when you have a good taste in series.<br>
	 One of the recently released series is called "SEE" though for my case iam currently doing the "ECHOES" serie about twin sisters where one got lost mysteriously.</p>
